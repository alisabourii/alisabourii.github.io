            This is AliSBR, A computer programmer, tech enthusiast. I started programming before high school with Python. In high school, I founded a robotics team for my school and began learning C++. After a while, I needed C# for some projects and learned that as well. I enjoy contributing creatively when working on robotics projects.
            I officially started working in the industry at the age of 17, joining a company. In my first official experience, I learned the APEX language. After that, I worked with C# and the .NET framework for about 1.5 years.
            My most significant professional experience so far has been working with PHP at Webticari, where I was part of a great team.
            As a freelancer, I develop web projects using JavaScript (React and Next.js) and ASP.NET. I also build mobile applications using Java and Kotlin.

            <p>
                Robotic programming was my first professional field of work.
                I started it in the first year of high school, and my high school journey ended in the final month of my last year.
                During this time, I learned many things. Over the course of four years, my roles evolved—I began as a student and developer, and eventually became a team captain and researcher.
                I've always loved it.

            My subject teacher and I started developing a Windows application to create more efficient essay-based exam systems and student seating arrangements for schools in Türkiye.
            I designed an algorithm for the KELEBEK system in C# and created the database architecture for this ambitious project.
            It was incredibly exciting for me at the time!
            Today, the project is being used by several high schools in Türkiye under the name "ERSYazılım".
