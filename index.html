            This is Ali Sabouri, A computer programmer, Electronic Engenner and tech enthusiast. I started programming before high school with Python. In high school, I founded a robotics team for my school and began learning C++. After a while, I needed C# for some projects and learned that as well. I enjoy contributing creatively when working on robotics projects.
            I officially started working in the industry at the age of 17, joining a company. In my first official experience, I learned the APEX language. After that, I worked with C# and the .NET framework for about 1.5 years.
            My most significant professional experience so far has been working with PHP at Webticari, where I was part of a great team.
            As a freelancer, I develop web projects using JavaScript (React and Next.js) and ASP.NET. I also build mobile applications using Java and Kotlin.

        <h2 >Techical Experience Filds</h2>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 2%">Robotic Programmer & Electronics</h3>
        <p class="DescraptionParagraf">
            Robotic programming was my first professional field of work.
            I started it in the first year of high school, and my high school journey ended in the final month of my last year.
            During this time, I learned many things. Over the course of four years, my roles evolvedâ€”I began as a student and developer, and eventually became a team captain and researcher.
            I've always loved it.
            <br>
            Now, I am working on digital filtering and digital signal processing. After a long time working as a software developer, I am gradually returning to robotics and electronics.
        </p>

        <h3>Windows Form App Developer</h3>
        <p class="DescraptionParagraf">
            My subject teacher and I started developing a Windows application to create more efficient essay-based exam systems and student seating arrangements for schools in TÃ¼rkiye.
            I designed an algorithm for the KELEBEK system in C# and created the database architecture for this ambitious project.
            It was incredibly exciting for me at the time!
            Today, the project is being used by several high schools in TÃ¼rkiye under the name "ERSYazÄ±lÄ±m".
        </p>

        <h3>Full Stack Web/Mobile Developer</h3>
        <p class="DescraptionParagraf">
            I proved myself in web development during my high school years.
            I started learning with HTML and CSS, then moved on to JavaScript for frontend development.
            Later, I began working with PHP, which became my strongest area as a web developer. I continuously expanded my knowledge and experience in PHP.
            Currently, I am working as a PHP Web Developer (Intern) at WEBTÄ°CARÄ° Software Company.
            <br>
            After gaining solid experience in web development, I challenged myself by starting Android app development.
            I began with Java, but later transitioned to Kotlin.
            Now, I collaborate with HNH Otomasyon on mobile application development.

        <h2>Top Projects</h2>
        <h3 style="margin-top: 2%"><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alisabourii/AndroidSuKa" style="color: black">Water Leak â€“ G300 Mobile Application</a></h3>
        <p class="DescraptionParagraf">
            Water Leak â€“ G300 is a specialized mobile application developed for professional technicians to detect water leaks. The app connects with the G300 device provided to the technician and helps identify possible leak points.<br>
            How It Works:<br>
            ðŸ”— Device Connection â€“ The app integrates seamlessly with the G300 water leak detection device.<br>
            ðŸŽ§ Sound Analysis â€“ The technician moves the device around areas where a leak is suspected. The sound data collected by the device is transferred to the app.<br>
            ðŸ“Š Graph & Measurement â€“ Incoming sound signals are displayed graphically within the app. Peak values are highlighted, and real-time measurements can be tracked.<br>
            ðŸ”Š Audio Output â€“ The app also outputs the received signals as sound, allowing the technician to listen in real time.<br>
            ðŸŽš Band Adjustment â€“ Users can adjust the frequency band of the sounds for more precise measurements.<br>

        <h3>Common Exam Management and Optimization System (ERSYazÄ±lÄ±m)</h3>
        <p class="DescraptionParagraf">
            Developed with C# and MySQL, this software aims to improve the security and efficiency of common exams in secondary schools.
            By implementing an innovative seating algorithm, the system optimized the distribution of students and proctors across exam halls,
            reducing cheating incidents by 60%.
            Through integration with the national "E-Okul" platform,
            student and teacher data were processed quickly and accurately,
            enabling standardized exam planning and reporting.
            With its user-friendly interface and advanced reporting tools, the system made exam organizations more fair, secure, and efficient.

        <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/alisabourii/koshar_air_purifier" style="color: black">Koshar Air Purifier</a></h3>
        <p class="DescraptionParagraf">
            The objective of this project is to develop a compact and portable system for monitoring and improving indoor air quality.
            The system uses sensors to continuously measure oxygen and humidity levels in the room and transmits this data in real-time to a website.
            This allows users to monitor the air quality of their environment instantly.
            Additionally, the system automatically sends notifications to alert the user when the measured values fall below or
            exceed predefined thresholds. The compact design of the device allows it to be easily used in any room,
            and its built-in battery enables it to operate independently for extended periods.
            The ultimate goal of this system is to provide a healthy and comfortable living environment indoors,
            optimize air quality, and minimize potential health risks.
